- instead of Average Guest, describe Atmosphere:

    is the tavern crowded?
    is the tavern decorated?
    are people celebrating a holiday?
    are people singing?
    how are customers feeling?
    what is the vibe in the tavern?
    is someone playing music?
    is the bar run by a family with children?
    Do the barmaids have a big cleavage (in a brothel ;D ) ?
    Do the waiters have a big packages (in a brothel ;D ) ?


- ideas for individuals:

    a strong-looking savage / a fierce pirate / a silently smirking sorcerer / a beloved adventurer ...  gets his drinks for free / is greeted by everyone who passes / seems to be the center of everyone's attention [ other gestures of respect ]

    a weakly savage / a totally drunken pirate / a sorcerer with big glasses / a drunken adventurer ...  gets bothered/mobbed by other guests [ other gestures of humiliation ]

    a group of adventurers planing their next quest / dungeon crawl/ counting their supplies

    a rampaged/exhausted-looking group of adventurers/ warriors enters the tavern behind you/ is resting from their last fight/ quest

    a fancy looking bard sings a story about an evil dragon

    a group of fresh adventurers talks about a monster/crocodiles in the sewers
